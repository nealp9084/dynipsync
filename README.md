# dynipsync
A free dynamic DNS tool for the name.com API

## Description 

dynipsync is a free, cross-platform dynamic DNS utility. This utility (dynipsync) will automatically update the specified name.com DNS A record whenever your IP address changes. At this time, dynipsync will only work with the name.com API.

## Why bother?

If you have a server running in your home (e.g., a webserver in your mom's basement), your IP address will probably keep changing. If you regularly interact with your server outside of the LAN, you would need to keep track of its IP address. What a nuisance!

Ideally, you would want to use a single domain name (e.g., code.example.com) instead of having to remember a different IP address every week. One way to solve the problem is to use Dynamic DNS. All you have to do is run an application on your server that will periodically update your DNS records.
